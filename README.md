This is capstone project of Data Science Specilaization course offered by John Hopkins University.

The goal for this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product in Shiny that provides a user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the ui.R and server.R source code files for the developed Shiny application as well as the RStudio Presenter files.

The Shiny application is hosted on shinyapps.io and the Presentation (slides) are available on RPubs.
